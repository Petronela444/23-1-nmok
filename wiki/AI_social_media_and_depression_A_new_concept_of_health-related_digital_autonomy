**The AIDDs could not only help those potentially affected but also relieve the burden from medical staff and healthcare systems.**

Early depression detection using AIDDs can assist people in receiving support and treatment on time, thereby preventing the problem from getting worse. When people struggle to recognize their own symptoms or are reluctant to get care, this can be especially helpful. AIDDs have the ability to lessen the strain on healthcare systems and medical staff by offering early intervention. It's crucial to remember that while AIDDs can be useful tools, they are not intended to take the place of healthcare experts or individualized care. The study shows that AIDDs have the potential to help and supplement current healthcare systems, but they should be viewed as tools rather than as a replacement for medical experts.

The value of privacy, ethics, and informed permission while using AI in mental health is another theoretical point that is frequently brought up in this research field. The use of AIDDs to analyze personal data from social media and other sources has raised questions about data privacy, data ownership, and potential exploitation of sensitive data. To address these issues and assure the responsible use of AI technology in mental health, researchers stress the necessity for strong ethical frameworks, transparency, and user consent. Furthermore, studies frequently note the restrictions and difficulties related to the application of AI in mental health. Although AI algorithms may offer insightful information, they are not perfect and may occasionally produce false positives or false negatives. It is recognised that significant variables that should complement AI-based techniques include the complexity of mental health issues, the subjectivity of symptoms, and the significance of human judgment and empathy in treatment. It is widely understood that human empathy and judgment are crucial components of treatment and should be used in conjunction with AI-based methods due to the complexity of mental health issues, the subjectivity of symptoms, and other significant considerations.

**Summary**
The study strongly focuses on the negative effects that the digitization of healthcare would bring to the issue of autonomy. It thoroughly points out that the relationship between the doctor and the patient (the human factor) is important. On the other hand, respecting the autonomous decisions of patients is a major obligation for physicians and other professionals in healthcare. The principle of respect for autonomy includes both negative and positive obligations, such as independence and respectful disclosure of information. They presuppose a traditional medical context in which the interactions between physicians and patients take place, while social media constitute an informal, nonmedical context. However, it is difficult to verify the identity of a certain person supposed to be informed about a mental issue within social media, and it can be difficult to assess the trustworthiness and quality of a digital offer. Digital communication technologies can be a source of misunderstanding, but they offer advantages such as easy accessibility, real-time translation, plain language, or the availability of knowledge resources. Social media can promote engagement and retention in mental health services, which could have beneficial effects on affected individuals' information and participation. In terms of empirical investigation, the study presents a study conducted by Reece and Danforth to identify predictive markers of depression in Instagram data using image processing, ML tools, and observation units. Results showed that photos posted by depressed users tend to be bluer, darker, and grayer, receive more comments and fewer likes, and have a lower average face count. Reece and others used methods of recruitment, data collection, and analysis to identify predictive markers for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder based on Twitter data. AI systems could lead to the assessment of an individual's mental health status with precision and efficiency on the expert level soon.
